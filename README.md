Problem Statement: Credit Card Lead Prediction
Happy Customer Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products, like Savings accounts, Current accounts, investment products, credit products, among other offerings.

The bank also cross-sells products to its existing customers and to do so they use different kinds of communication like tele-calling, e-mails, recommendations on net banking, mobile banking, etc.

In this case, the Happy Customer Bank wants to cross sell its credit cards to its existing customers. The bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards.

Now, the bank is looking for your help in identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card, given:

• Customer details (gender, age, region etc.)

• Details of his/her relationship with the bank (Channel_Code,Vintage, 'Avg_Asset_Value etc.)

Problem Definition
We are going to build classification models which will predict propensity (probability) of customers who are willing to take the credit card offer by the Happy Bank. The probabilities from the model will be used to classify the outcome and identify variables that influence the response. The goal is to build a model that identifies customers who are most likely to accept the offer in future.
